# esp32_zip
minimal library to zip files for ex bulk download

I had the need to zip files together for bulk downloads in a project and could not find any done solutions. I hope this can save someone else a few hours of headscratching.

This is the minimum of what i needed, it will not be developed further(feel free).
It works on esp32-s2-saola-1 but it should probably work on more boards than that.
